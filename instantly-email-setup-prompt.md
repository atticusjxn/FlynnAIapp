# Instantly.ai Email Sequence Setup for Flynn AI

I need you to set up a complete cold email sequence in Instantly.ai for my SaaS product, Flynn AI. Use the Instantly MCP tools to create this campaign.

## Product Context

**Flynn AI** is an AI receptionist for service businesses (tradespeople, contractors, small business owners). It answers missed calls, transcribes voicemails, extracts job details with AI, and automates follow-up via SMS.

**Value Proposition:** "Flynn turns missed calls into booked jobs"

**Pricing:**
- 1-week free trial
- $79/month (Professional plan) - this is our Mates Rates special pricing
- $99/month (standard pricing)
- Includes AI call answering, voicemail transcription, job card creation, SMS follow-up

**Target Audience:** Australian tradespeople and service business owners (plumbers, electricians, HVAC contractors, landscapers, handymen, carpenters, painters, roofers, etc.)

## Campaign Details

**Campaign Name:** "Flynn" (this campaign already exists in Instantly with 1,000+ leads)

**Leads:** Already uploaded and cleaned in the "Flynn" campaign

## Email Sequence to Create

### Email 1 (Day 1): Problem Awareness + Trial Offer

**Subject Line Options (A/B test these):**
1. "G'day {{firstName}} - Never miss another $500 job"
2. "{{firstName}}, are you losing jobs because you can't answer your phone?"
3. "Never miss a job call again (1 week free)"

**Email Body:**
```
G'day {{firstName}},

Quick question: How many calls do you miss when you're up on a roof or deep in a job?

I'm Atticus, founder of Flynn AI. We built an AI receptionist specifically for tradies like you.

Here's how it works:
→ Your phone forwards missed calls to Flynn
→ AI answers professionally, transcribes the voicemail
→ Extracts job details (name, phone, service needed, urgency)
→ Texts the lead back while you're working
→ Creates a job card in your dashboard

One Brisbane plumber told me last week: "Flynn booked me 8 jobs in my first week. Paid for itself 10x over."

**Try it free for 1 week.** No credit card required.

After that, it's just $79/month. (We normally charge $99, but you're getting our Mates Rates pricing.)

```

**Variables to personalize:**
- `{{firstName}}` - Lead's first name
- `{{company}}` - Their business name (if available)

### Email 2 (Day 3): Social Proof

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "{{firstName}} - 3 Brisbane tradies closed $12K in jobs this week"
2. "See what Flynn did for [Tradie Name]"
3. "Real results: How tradies are using Flynn AI"

**Email Body:**
```
Hey {{firstName}},

Following up on my email about never missing calls.

Just wanted to share what happened this week with one of our users:

**Dave (Electrician, Sydney):**
- Flynn answered 23 calls while he was on jobs
- Booked 7 new jobs automatically
- Made ~$4,200 in revenue he would have missed

Here's a screenshot of his dashboard:
[DASHBOARD_SCREENSHOT_IMAGE]

The best part? He set it up in 5 minutes.

**Want to try it for free this week?**

No credit card needed. Just see if Flynn can book you even ONE extra job.

Start your free week: https://flynn.ai/trial

Cheers,
Atticus

P.S. - If you're skeptical, I get it. That's why the first week is completely free. See it work, then decide.
```

### Email 3 (Day 7): Urgency + Scarcity

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "{{firstName}} - Limited Mates Rates pricing closing soon"
2. "Last chance: $79/month pricing (normally $99)"
3. "Only 12 spots left at $79/month"

**Email Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

Last email, I promise.

We're limiting our launch to 100 tradies this month so we can give everyone white-glove onboarding.

**Only 12 spots left** at our Mates Rates pricing ($79/month instead of $99).

Once you lock it in, you keep that price **forever**.

Here's what you get:
✓ AI answers every missed call (even at 2am)
✓ Transcribes voicemails instantly
✓ Texts leads back automatically
✓ Creates job cards with all the details
✓ 1 week free trial to test it out

**This pricing closes Friday.** After that, it's back to $99/month.

Claim your $79 forever pricing: https://flynn.ai/trial

Or if you want a quick demo first, grab a time here: [CALENDAR_LINK]

Cheers,
Atticus
Flynn AI

P.S. - Even if you're not ready right now, hit reply and I'll save a spot for you at the $79 rate.
```

### Email 4 (Day 10): Breakup + Last Chance

**Subject Line Options:**
1. "{{firstName}} - should I close your file?"
2. "Is this a bad time?"
3. "Last email (for real this time)"

**Email Body:**
```
Hey {{firstName}},

I haven't heard back from you, so I'm guessing one of three things:

1. **You're slammed with work** (great problem to have!)
2. **You're skeptical about AI** (fair enough)
3. **My emails are going to spam** (oops)

If it's #1 or #2, no worries. I'll leave you alone.

But if you ever want to see how Flynn can help you never miss another lead, just reply "interested" and I'll set you up with a free week.

No hard sell. Just show you how it works, and you decide.

Cheers,
Atticus
Flynn AI

P.S. - If you want me to stop emailing you, just reply "not interested" and I'll remove you from the list immediately.
```
