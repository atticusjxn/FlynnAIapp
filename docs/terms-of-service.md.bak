# Flynn AI Terms of Service

_Last updated: February 22, 2025_

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Flynn AI mobile application, Koala concierge voice experience, websites, and related services (the “Service”). By creating an account or using the Service you agree to these Terms and to our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md). If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or organisation, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity to these Terms.

## 1. Account Registration & Security
- You must provide accurate account information and keep your credentials secure. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.
- If you suspect unauthorised use, notify us immediately at support@flynnai.com.
- Flynn may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or disrupt other users.

## 2. Use of the Service
- Flynn AI provides an AI receptionist that captures missed calls, transcribes voicemails, summarises jobs, and routes notifications to your team.
- You are responsible for: (a) obtaining any caller consent required to record or transcribe calls in your jurisdiction, and (b) configuring greetings that disclose the use of AI/recording where required.
- You must not misuse the Service (e.g., by attempting to access other users’ data, reverse engineering components, or uploading malicious content).

## 3. Subscriptions & Billing
- Paid features require an active subscription (e.g., Concierge Basic or Concierge Growth). Prices and allowances are described in the app or on flynnai.com.
- Subscriptions renew automatically each billing cycle unless cancelled at least 24 hours before renewal.
- Payments are processed by Stripe. By subscribing you authorise Flynn and Stripe to charge the payment method on file.
- Fees are non-refundable except where required by law. We may issue prorated credits if we materially fail to deliver the Service.

## 4. Acceptable Content & Caller Data
- You retain ownership of the call recordings, transcripts, job notes, and other data you submit.
- You grant Flynn a limited licence to process that data solely to provide and improve the Service.
- You must not submit content that is illegal, infringing, abusive, or violates privacy rights. Flynn may remove or block content that violates these Terms.

## 5. Third-Party Services
- The Service integrates with third parties (e.g., Twilio, Supabase, Stripe, LLM/TTS vendors). Use of those services may be subject to additional terms.
- Flynn is not responsible for outages or acts/omissions of third parties, but we work to mitigate disruptions.

## 6. Intellectual Property
- Flynn and its licensors own all rights, title, and interest in the Service, including software, branding, Koala Concierge assets, and documentation.
- You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Service except as expressly allowed by these Terms.

## 7. Disclaimers
- THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. Flynn does not guarantee that the Service will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that AI outputs will be accurate.
- You are responsible for verifying job summaries, transcripts, and automated drafts before acting on them.

## 8. Limitation of Liability
- TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, FLYNN AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR BUSINESS.
- Flynn’s total liability for any claim will not exceed the amounts paid by you to Flynn in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## 9. Cancellation & Suspension
- You may cancel your subscription at any time via the app or by emailing support@flynnai.com. Upon cancellation, you retain access until the end of the paid term.
- Flynn may suspend or terminate access if you breach these Terms, misuse the Service, or fail to pay fees. We will provide notice where reasonably possible.

## 10. Changes to the Service or Terms
- We may modify the Service (e.g., add or remove features) and may update these Terms when necessary. Material changes will be announced via email or in-app. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.

## 11. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
- These Terms are governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.
- Any disputes will be resolved in the courts located in Melbourne, Victoria, unless applicable law requires otherwise.
