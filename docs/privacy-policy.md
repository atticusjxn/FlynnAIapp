# Flynn AI Privacy Policy

_Last updated: February 22, 2025_

Flynn AI (“Flynn”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) provides an AI receptionist that captures missed calls, converts them into structured job summaries, and helps teams follow up quickly. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and share information when you use the Flynn mobile app, the Flynn concierge experience, and related services (collectively, the “Service”).

By creating an account or using the Service you agree to the practices described below. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Account & Contact Information
- Name, email address, company name, and phone number that you submit when creating an account or contacting support.
- Authentication data from Supabase (session tokens, user IDs) that keeps you signed in.

### 1.2 Business Configuration
- Greeting scripts, intake questions, receptionist modes, custom acknowledgement phrases, and forwarding preferences that you configure in the app.
- Calendar connection metadata (not calendar contents) when you link an external calendar.

### 1.3 Call & Voicemail Data
- Missed-call metadata (caller ID, timestamp, duration) collected once you forward calls to your Flynn number.
- Voicemail audio recordings, AI-generated transcripts, summaries, and job notes created from those recordings.
- Status events showing whether a voicemail was processed or forwarded to your team.

### 1.4 Device & Usage Data
- Device identifiers (e.g., push notification tokens), mobile OS version, and app version for diagnostics and notifications.
- Log files about in-app actions (saving scripts, testing concierge flows, configuring call forwarding).

### 1.5 Optional Voice Samples
- If you record a custom concierge voice we store the uploaded audio file, derived embeddings, and cloning status until you delete the profile.

## 2. How We Use Information
- Deliver, maintain, and improve the Service (e.g., provisioning numbers, transcribing voicemails, sending notifications).
- Personalise scripts, voices, and job summaries based on your configuration.
- Provide customer support, troubleshoot issues, and secure the platform.
- Communicate important updates, billing notices, and onboarding guidance.
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.

We do **not** sell personal data to third parties.

## 3. Legal Bases
When required by applicable law (e.g., GDPR), we rely on the following legal bases:
- Performance of a contract (delivering agreed-upon concierge services).
- Legitimate interests (improving reliability, preventing abuse).
- Consent (recording caller audio in the call-forwarding greeting, cloning a custom voice, sending marketing updates).

## 4. How We Share Information
We share data only with service providers who help us operate the Service:
- **Supabase** for authentication, databases, storage, and serverless functions.
- **Twilio** for phone number provisioning, call forwarding, and voicemail collection.
- **Stripe** for billing, subscription management, and payment processing.
- **Expo / EAS, Apple, and Google** for app distribution, push notifications, and error diagnostics.
- **LLM/TTS vendors** (e.g., OpenAI, Grok/X.ai, ElevenLabs, Azure Speech) strictly to transcribe, summarise, or synthesise the content you send.

Each provider is bound by contract to protect your data and use it only for the purposes described above. We may also disclose information if required by law, in response to legal requests, or to protect our rights, safety, or property.

## 5. Data Retention
- Account data: retained while your account is active and for up to 24 months after cancellation unless you request earlier deletion.
- Voicemails & transcripts: retained for 90 days by default; you can request shorter retention or deletion via support.
- Custom voice samples: retained until you delete the voice profile or close your account.
- Analytics logs: retained up to 12 months.

## 6. Security
We use TLS encryption in transit, encryption at rest, access controls, and monitoring to protect data. No method of transmission is 100% secure, so we encourage you to use strong passwords, enable device security, and notify us immediately of suspicious activity.

## 7. Your Choices & Rights
Depending on where you live, you may have the right to:
- Access, correct, or delete your personal data.
- Export your data in a portable format.
- Object to or restrict certain processing activities.
- Withdraw consent (e.g., stop voice cloning, unsubscribe from marketing).

Submit requests by emailing privacy@flynnai.com or by visiting [https://flynnai.app/delete-account](https://flynnai.app/delete-account). We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling a request.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
The Service is not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child provided data to us, contact privacy@flynnai.com so we can delete it.

## 9. International Transfers
We store data primarily in the United States and may transfer it to other countries where we or our processors operate. We rely on contractual safeguards (e.g., SCCs) for such transfers when required by law.

## 10. Updates to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be announced via email or in-app notice. Continued use after notice means you accept the revised policy.
