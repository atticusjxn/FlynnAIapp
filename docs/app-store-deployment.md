### Step 6: Build & Upload with EAS

Flynn AI uses Expo, so we'll use EAS (Expo Application Services) to build.

#### A. Install EAS CLI
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
```

#### B. Configure EAS Build
```bash
# Initialize EAS in your project
eas build:configure
```

This creates `eas.json`. Update it:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 5.9.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "ios": {
        "resourceClass": "m-medium"
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "ios": {
        "resourceClass": "m-medium"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "resourceClass": "m-medium",
        "bundleIdentifier": "com.flynnai.app",
        "buildConfiguration": "Release"
      },
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "appleId": "your-apple-id@example.com",
        "ascAppId": "your-app-store-connect-id",
        "appleTeamId": "YOUR_TEAM_ID"
      },
      "android": {
        "serviceAccountKeyPath": "./google-service-account.json",
        "track": "internal"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### C. Update app.config.js for Production

Ensure your `app.config.js` has:
```javascript
export default {
  expo: {
    name: "Flynn AI",
    slug: "FlynnAI",
    version: "1.0.0",
    ios: {
      bundleIdentifier: "com.flynnai.app",
      buildNumber: "1",
      supportsTablet: true,
      infoPlist: {
        NSUserNotificationUsageDescription: "Flynn AI sends push notifications when new jobs are created so you never miss important follow-ups.",
        NSMicrophoneUsageDescription: "Flynn AI uses the microphone to record and transcribe phone calls with clients to automatically capture job details and create bookings.",
        // ... other permissions
      }
    },
    android: {
      package: "com.flynnai.app",
      versionCode: 1,
      adaptiveIcon: {
        foregroundImage: "./assets/images/adaptive-icon.png",
        backgroundColor: "#3B82F6"
      },
      permissions: [
        "RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED",
        "VIBRATE",
        "USE_FINGERPRINT",
        "RECORD_AUDIO"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### D. Build for iOS Production
```bash
# Create production build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# This will:
# 1. Prompt you to log in with your Apple Developer account
# 2. Create provisioning profiles automatically
# 3. Build your app on Expo's servers
# 4. Generate an .ipa file

# Wait 10-20 minutes for build to complete
```

#### E. Submit to App Store
```bash
# Option 1: Auto-submit via EAS
eas submit --platform ios --latest

# Option 2: Manual upload
# Download the .ipa file from EAS dashboard
# Upload via Xcode → Organizer → Distribute App
```
