      question: "How does call forwarding work?",
      answer: "Simply set up conditional call forwarding on your phone (takes 10 seconds). When you can&apos;t answer, calls forward to Flynn AI. Your callers hear your custom greeting, leave details, and our AI processes everything automatically. You maintain complete control and can disable forwarding anytime.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is my call data secure and private?",
      answer: "Absolutely. All voicemails are encrypted in transit and at rest. We&apos;re SOC 2 compliant and follow GDPR/CCPA regulations. Your data is never shared with third parties, and you can export or delete everything at any time.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if the AI gets something wrong?",
      answer: "You review and approve everything before it&apos;s sent. Flynn AI drafts responses and creates job cards, but you have final say. Our accuracy rate is 95%+, and any edits you make help train the system to work better for your business.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use my existing phone number?",
      answer: "Yes! Flynn works with your current business number. You simply set up call forwarding for unanswered calls. Alternatively, we can provision a dedicated Flynn number if you prefer.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do my callers know they&apos;re being recorded?",
      answer: "Your greeting (which you customize) includes disclosure that the call may be recorded for quality purposes. This is standard practice and legally compliant in all jurisdictions we operate in.",
    },
    {
      question: "What industries do you support?",
      answer: "Flynn AI works with any business that takes phone calls. We&apos;re especially popular with tradespeople, real estate agents, legal professionals, medical practices, sales teams, and consultants. The AI adapts to your industry-specific terminology.",
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the AI extraction?",
      answer: "Flynn AI achieves 95%+ accuracy for name, phone number, and service type extraction. Date/time accuracy is 90%+. You always review the extracted data before approving, so nothing gets sent without your verification.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
      answer: "Yes. No contracts, no cancellation fees. Cancel anytime from your settings. Your data remains accessible for 30 days after cancellation, and you can export everything before then.",
    },
    {
      question: "What&apos;s included in the 7-day free trial?",
      answer: "Full access to all Pro features: 1000 minutes of AI receptionist calls, automatic transcription, job card creation, calendar sync, email summaries, SMS notifications, and all integrations. No credit card required to start.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does processing take?",
      answer: "Most voicemails are transcribed and processed within 2 minutes. You&apos;ll receive a transcript, calendar event, email summary, and SMS notificationâ€”all ready for your review.",
